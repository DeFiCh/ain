# Setup nodes

> NOTE: This section is a work in progress for DeFi Blockchain.

Setting up nodes are exactly similar to how to run a node from the command-line for Bitcoin. We'll update these instructions shortly, meanwhile please follow any bitcoin instructions, substituting the binaries name of bitcoin for defi, that's available under the `bin` dir.

The default data directory is `~/.defi`, with the default conf read from `~/.defi/defi.conf` if found.
