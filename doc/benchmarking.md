Benchmarking
============

> NOTE: This section is a work in progress for DeFi Blockchain, and may not be applicable at it's current state.

Bitcoin Core has an internal benchmarking framework, with benchmarks
for cryptographic algorithms (e.g. SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, RIPEMD160, Poly1305, ChaCha20), rolling bloom filter, coins selection,
thread queue, wallet balance.

Running
---------------------

For benchmarks purposes you only need to compile `bitcoin_bench`. Beware of configuring without `--enable-debug` as this would impact
benchmarking by unlatching log printers and lock analysis.

    make -C src bench_bitcoin

After compiling bitcoin-core, the benchmarks can be run with:

    src/bench/bench_bitcoin

The output will look similar to:
```
# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median
AssembleBlock, 5, 700, 1.79954, 0.000510913, 0.000517018, 0.000514497
...
```

Help
---------------------

    src/bench/bench_bitcoin --help

To print options like scaling factor or per-benchmark filter.

Notes
---------------------
More benchmarks are needed for, in no particular order:
- Script Validation
- Coins database
- Memory pool
- Cuckoo Cache
- P2P throughput
