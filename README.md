## What is [DeFiChain](https://defichain.com)?

DeFiChainâ€™s primary vision is to enable decentralized finance with Bitcoin-grade security, strength and immutability.
It's a blockchain dedicated to fast, intelligent and transparent financial services, accessible by everyone.
Merges from upstream (Bitcoin Core) will be done selectively if it applies to the improved functionality and security of
DeFiChain.
