## What is [DeFiChain](https://defichain.com)?

It's a blockchain dedicated to fast, intelligent and transparent financial services, accessible by everyone.

> **NOTE**: _master_ branch is a development branch and is not suitable for production. Please download [tagged releases](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/releases) or compile from the release tags.

### Bitcoin Core

DeFiChain is a fork on [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) from
commit [7d6f63c](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7d6f63cc2c2b9c4f07a43619eef0b7314474fffd) – which is slightly
after v0.18.1 of Bitcoin Core.

DeFiChain has done significant modifications from Bitcoin Core, for instance:

- Moving from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake
- Masternode model
- Community fund support
- Bitcoin blockchain block anchoring
- Increased decentralized financial transaction and opcode support, etc.
- Configuration defaults (mainnet ports: `8555/4`, testnet ports: `18555/4`, regnet ports: `19555/4`, etc)

Merges from upstream (Bitcoin Core) will be done selectively if it applies to the improved functionality and security of
DeFiChain.
