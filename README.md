What is DeFi Blockchain?
----------------

DeFi Blockchain's primary vision is to enable decentralized finance with Bitcoin-grade security, strength and immutability. It's a blockchain dedicated to fast, intelligent and transparent financial services, accessible by everyone.

For more information:

- Visit the [DeFi Blockchain website](https://defichain.io)
- Read our [white paper](https://defichain.io/white-paper/)

Downloadable binaries will be made available soon.

#### Bitcoin Core

DeFi Blockchain is a fork on [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) from commit [7d6f63c](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7d6f63cc2c2b9c4f07a43619eef0b7314474fffd) – which is slightly after v0.18.1 of Bitcoin Core.

DeFi Blockchain has done significant modifications from Bitcoin Core, for instance:

- Moving from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake
- Masternode model
- Community fund support
- Bitcoin blockchain block anchoring
- Increased decentralized financial transaction and opcode support, etc.

Merges from upstream (Bitcoin Core) will be done selectively if it applies to the improved functionality and security of DeFi Blockchain.
