/*  from https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#Merkle_Trees
    Merkle trees are binary trees of hashes. Merkle trees in bitcoin use a double SHA-256, the SHA-256 hash of the
    SHA-256 hash of something. If, when forming a row in the tree (other than the root of the tree), it would have an odd
    number of elements, the final double-hash is duplicated to ensure that the row has an even number of hashes. First
    form the bottom row of the tree with the ordered double-SHA-256 hashes of the byte streams of the transactions in the
    block. Then the row above it consists of half that number of hashes. Each entry is the double-SHA-256 of the 64-byte
    concatenation of the corresponding two hashes below it in the tree. This procedure repeats recursively until we reach
    a row consisting of just a single double-hash. This is the merkle root of the tree.

    from https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki#Partial_Merkle_branch_format
    The encoding works as follows: we traverse the tree in depth-first order, storing a bit for each traversed node,
    signifying whether the node is the parent of at least one matched leaf txid (or a matched txid itself). In case we
    are at the leaf level, or this bit is 0, its merkle node hash is stored, and its children are not explored further.
    Otherwise, no hash is stored, but we recurse into both (or the only) child branch. During decoding, the same
    depth-first traversal is performed, consuming bits and hashes as they were written during encoding.

    example tree with three transactions, where only tx2 is matched by the bloom filter:

       merkleRoot
        /     \
      m1       m2
     /  \     /  \
    tx1  tx2 tx3  tx3

    flag bits (little endian): 00001011 [merkleRoot = 1, m1 = 1, tx1 = 0, tx2 = 1, m2 = 0, byte padding = 000]
    hashes: [tx1, tx2, m2]

    NOTE: this merkle tree design has a security vulnerability (CVE-2012-2459), which can be defended against by
    considering the merkle root invalid if there are duplicate hashes in any rows with an even number of elements
