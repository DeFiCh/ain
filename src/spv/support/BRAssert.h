/**
 * BRAssert() is meant to replace assert() so as to provide a meaningful assert in 'release'
 * builds. Normally assert() is disabled in a 'release' build - the condition is evaluated and a
 * log message is produce, but the program doesn't exit.  Thus to program continues only to fail
 * later, unceremoniously killing the App in some way.  In Core code a failed assertion is truely
 * fatal - it is not meaningful for Core to continue.
 *
 * When `condition` is false(0), BRAssert() invokes __BRFail().
 *
 * @param condition if false, assert.

 * Install a handler for a BRAssert failure.  If `BRAssert(0)` occurs, then the provided handler
 * will be invokdd as `handler(info)`.  The handler runs in a pthread (not in a Unix signal
 * context) and thus it can do anything.
 *
 * Invocation of the handler implies that Core has failed.  The appropriate response is to
 * delete/release all Core resources (Bitcoin/Ethereum Wallets/Transfer) and to restart Core w/
 * a FULL-SYNC for all blockchains.
 *
 * BRAssertInstall() should be called before Core is used.  Thus before wallets, peer managers,
 * wallet managers, etc are created.
 *
 * If BRAssertInstall() is not called before BRFail() is invoked, then Core will fail and the App
 * will crash, as if `exit()` were invoked.
 *
 * Once BRAssertInstall() is called, it runs continuously - no matter how many failures and no
 * matter how many recoveries.  It thus need not be called again.  When the App will quit, a call
 * to BRAssertUninstall() should be made to cleanly stop.  If BRAssertInstall() needs to be called
 * again, say to install a different 'handler', then BRAssertUninstall() should be called.
 *
 * The `handle` CAN NOT call BRAssertUninstall() any of BRAssertRemoveRecovery().  Consequences
 * are undetermined (an exit(), a deadlock).

/**
 * Define a recovery handler.  On a BRAssert(0) the recovery handlers are invoked to clean up any
 * Core threads, essentially to shut down Core.  Multiple recovery handlers can be installed and
 * all will be run to completion before the BRAssertHandler is invoked.
 *
 * This function installs one handler for each `info` value.  If invoked multiple times with the
 * same `info`, then the handler will be replaced.
 *
 * This is `semi-private` because it should only be used internally for Core shutdown.  A typical
 * use would be for BRPeerManager or BREthereumEWM where the recovery handler would be
 * BRPeerManagerDisconnect() or BREthereumEWMDisconnect().  If some process invoked BRFail(), like
 * one BRPeer thread, then BRPeerManagerDisconnect would be called to stop the peer manager and all
 * remaining peer threads.
 *
 * Not every pthread needs to define a recovery; only the top-level thread(s), responsible for
 * all sub-threads need a recovery handler.  For example BREthereumEWM manages BREthereumBCS which
 * itself manages BREthereumLES.  A recovery for BREthereumEWM of 'disconnect' will disconnect
 * BCS which will disconnect LES - leading to a circumstance where all threads have stopped.
 *
 * Once all recoveries run there should be no Core threads running.
 *
 * The 'handler' cannot call BRAssertRemoveRecovery(); the consequences are undetermined.  If a
 * remove is necessary, do it in the clean up part of the pthread routine as:
 *
 * void *someThread (void *ignore) {
 *   BRAssertDefineRecovery (...)
 *
 *   while (!quit) { }
 *
 *   BRAssertRemoveRecovery (...)
