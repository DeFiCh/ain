<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to the DeFi Blockchain.

If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue!

For reporting security issues, please email us at engineering@defichain.io with you detailed instructions, as below.

<!-- What version of DeFi Blockchain are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->

<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->
