# Metachain JSON-RPC CLI

`metachain-cli` is a command-line interface for interacting with defichain EVM endpoint via JSON-RPC.

## Features

- Supports both mainnet and custom chains (e.g., devnet)

## Usage

To get started with `metachain-cli`, use the following command:

```bash
metachain-cli --help
```

This will display the available options and subcommands for the CLI. To specify a custom chain, use the -c or --chain option followed by the chain name:

```bash
metachain-cli -c devnet <SUBCOMMAND>
```

For detailed information on a specific subcommand, run `metachain-cli <SUBCOMMAND> --help`
