# It is not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will
# be overwritten during package upgrades. If you want to add further
# options or overwrite existing ones then use
# $ systemctl edit defid.service
# See "man systemd.service" for details.

# Note that almost all daemon options could be specified in
# /etc/defi/defi.conf, but keep in mind those explicitly
# specified as arguments in ExecStart= will override those in the
# config file.
